Trivial Problems:
The intent behind these is to be extremely easy, to ease
the student in. For some, it may be enough to develop a
pattern (if b divides a, then it is 0, anything mod 10 is
the last digit etc).

48 mod 3
13 mod 10
57 mod 1


Easy Problems:
These problems require little computation. Ideally should
be used if it is a student's first time wrapping their mind
around something like the ring of integers mod p.

29 mod 5
83 mod 7
-30 mod 2
-9 mod 16


Medium Problems:
Require more computation. Allows the student to practice
what I believe is called the exponent rule.

3^5 mod 6
7^5 - 3^5 mod 5


Hard Problems:
They'll need some paper.

16 * 37^-1 mod 11
-19^5 mod 13
